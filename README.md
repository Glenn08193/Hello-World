# Hello-World
Hi Humans!

Mother Earth here, First, go stand or sit in nature. Allow yourself to be drawn to something of natureâ€”a tree, for example. Then take three cleansing breaths. With each breath, allow your mind to become present to the tree right now, free of any worries or thoughts; you might imagine a whiteboard in your mind and wiping off those worries or thoughts.
